There are a few default attributes and methods for class objects.
Instances are operated under the these type of functions, signify by the double underscores in front and after the function.

__init__ : initiate an instance
__str__: define an input to be type "string"
__len__: count the length of the instance
__repr__: produce a string representation


Next we learn about the underscore notation of the instance, _ means private instance only appear inside the class definition, __ means the privaate and invisible inside the class definition.

E.g 

class P:
    def __init__(self,x):
        self.__x = x
    def __int__(self):
        return self.x
    def get_x(self):
        return self.__x
    def set_x(self, x):
        self.__x = x
        
        
self.__x=x sets in input x as the instance
get_x sets the instance as self
p1=P(42)
